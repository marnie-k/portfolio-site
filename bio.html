I began my tech career in the 1990s working as a help desk
provider. I moved on to teaching classes in software and network applications,
and eventually became the database manager for the Epidemiology Unit at Mass
Eye and Ear. I went on hiatus when my children were young and re-entered the
workforce as a teacher. I returned to tech to launch a product line on Amazon,
developing and managing over 100 listings for the Victoria Gourmet spice
company.
